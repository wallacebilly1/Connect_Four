# Connect Four
#### M1 Paired Project for Jared, Grant and Billy

## Background
Connect Four is a classic board game where players take turns trying to create a line of four of their own pieces without being blocked by their opponent. The game ends when one of the two players successfully lines up four of their pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally and wins, or in a draw if the 7-column, 6-row grid is filled without either player successfully connecting four pieces. For more information, see the [wikipedia page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)

## Written Reflection

#### 1. This project did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach the design and problem solving process for this project?

We approached the design and problem solving initially with a freeform page that we used for brainstorming and getting our ideas on paper. This allowed us to think through which classes we would need to create and how those classes would interract with one another.

#### 2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

If we had one more day to work on this project, we would want to:

- add in color to the game (colored pieces, colored board)
- add in more ascii art for player and game
- refactor our current code
- add in the ability to have two human players play against each other
- add in more complexity to the computer bot

#### 3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

We primarily used driver-navigator pairing techniques when working throughout this project. When working on this project, we would all meet up in a breakout room in the Study Hall and one person would drive while the other two helped navigate / pitch ideas.

#### 4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

Since we worked together most of the time, most of our feedback was given live while coding. We left feedback in the comments on GitHub after a pull request which was more constructive.
